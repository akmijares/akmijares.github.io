# Who am I?

![A picture of me scuba diving](/assets/img/about-page.png)

My name is Antonio Karlo Mijares. I was born in the Philippines and
immigrated to Canada in May 2009. I've been living here ever since.

I've been a fan of technology since high school.
Watching [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/user/LinusTechTips) and
hearing my classmates talk about PC building is what got me hooked.

I'm currently studying at
[Seneca College](https://www.senecacollege.ca/home.html)
where I hope to gain the skills to work in the IT field.

Don't know where to start? Try my [Resume](/resume), and don't hesitate to
