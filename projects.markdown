    description: A Surveilance system with (mostly) POE cameras. With the recent rampants of scam solicitors and break-ins, my dad and I wanted to figure out a way to beef up the security around the house by adding security cameras. Since he didn't want to pay for a subscription (i.e Nest, Ring, etc.), and I wasn't really comfortable of not having complete control of our data, I was able to introduce him with the Unifi Protect ecosystem, where we got to build our own system and not be tied down to subscriptions and loss of data control. After afternoons of wiring up POE cameras, we were able to add security in areas around the house in order to monitor what goes around.

    description: A rewrite of my Grade 12 culminating. I wanted to see if I could rewrite my <a href="https://github.com/Speedy905/Video-Game-Storage-Creator">Grade 12 culminating assignment</a> using Bash. I was actually able to do the experimentation, which allowed me to release a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in less than a week.

      alt: Email server
    description: A custom email server. I've wanted to experiment on server hosting, especially on a VPS, so I've decided to buy a virtual instance on Vultr, and followed <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/emailwiz">Luke Smith's script</a>, which resulted in a working email server. An email server wasn't exactly my first choice, but it was interesting to tackle upon

    description: A backup and restore for qcow2 files. Inspired from one of my courses, since I deal with Virtual machines with virt-manager alot, I wanted an easier way to backup and restore my virtual machines without having to type out commands one by one.

    description: A family NAS. Using Unraid and salvaging older parts, I was able to create a NAS for my family to use. It also acts as a Plex server, so they can watch any locally-hosted content. It currently has 7TB of total space.

      alt: Arch Linux Logo
    description: Using Arch as a primary operating system. With my basic Linux knowledge that I've acquired over the years, I wanted to experiment/play around with it more, which lead me to the installation of Arch Linux. My current laptop, a hand-me-down t430s has Arch Linux installed.
  - title: My first PC build (May 2016).

      alt: My first PC
    description: My first PC build. With the knowledge that I received about PC building, I wanted to apply that knowledge into actually doing it. With the success of it, it brought me to where I am, fascinated on technology and computers. It ran on a I5-4590, paired with a R9 380 GPU.
